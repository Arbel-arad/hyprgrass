# Hyprland Touch Gestures

⚠️ WARNING this plugin is very alpha, expect breaking changes!

## Features/Roadmap

- [x] Workspace Swipe (currently only 3 finger allowed)
  - [ ] Configurable finger count
- [ ] Custom commands
- [ ] Swipe From Edge
- [ ] _n_-Finger swipe

## Configuring

There is no plugin-specific options at the moment, however, I recommend you adjust the settings of the builtin gesture to make it easier to switch workspaces:

```config
gestures {
  workspace_swipe = true
  workspace_swipe_cancel_ratio = 0.15
}
```
